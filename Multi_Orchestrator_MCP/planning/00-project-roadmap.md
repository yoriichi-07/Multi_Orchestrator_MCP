# 🏆 Autonomous Software Foundry - Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Vision
Build an MCP server that orchestrates specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, Reviewer) to autonomously generate, test, and self-heal full-stack web applications. This showcases the critical need for secure, permissioned, and observable AI agent interfaces.

## 🏅 Winning Narrative
*"While anyone can ask an LLM to write code, the result is an unreliable prototype. We've built a reliable software factory. Our system uses specialized agents, curated prompt libraries, and closed-loop feedback to test and automatically fix its own code. Every step is secured by Descope's granular permissions and made fully observable by Cequence, transforming chaos into trustworthy, production-ready engineering."*
