**Symptoms**: Generation requests failing or slow
**Solution**:
- Switch to backup LLM provider
- Use pre-generated examples
- Demonstrate with cached responses

## Issue: Database/Cache Connectivity
**Symptoms**: Application errors, data not persisting
**Solution**:
- Switch to in-memory database mode
- Use SQLite fallback
- Demonstrate with mock data

## Issue: Deployment Platform Issues
**Symptoms**: Applications not deploying, URLs not accessible
**Solution**:
- Use backup hosting platform
