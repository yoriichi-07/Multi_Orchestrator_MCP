# Docker Deployment Fix

## Problem Summary
The Smithery deployment was failing because the `/app/start-production.sh` script was not found during container startup due to permission issues in the Dockerfile.

## Root Causes
1. **Permission Issues**: RUN commands after USER switch caused permission failures
2. **Script Timing**: Startup script creation happened at wrong time in build process
3. **Smithery Integration**: Startup script wasn't properly accessible to Smithery's process

## Solution Applied
1. **Dockerfile Restructure**: Moved all root-level operations before USER switch
2. **Script Verification**: Added verification steps to ensure script exists and is executable
3. **Smithery Configuration**: Updated smithery.yaml with explicit startup commands
4. **Testing Tools**: Added local testing script for validation

## Verification Steps
1. Run `docker-test.sh` locally to verify build
2. Check that startup script exists: `docker run --rm <image> ls -la /app/start-production.sh`
3. Verify permissions: `docker run --rm <image> test -x /app/start-production.sh`
4. Test startup: `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 <image>`

## Deployment Process
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to repository
3. Smithery will automatically rebuild and deploy
4. Monitor deployment logs for successful startup

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check Smithery logs for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all required files are included in Docker context
4. Test locally using the provided test script
