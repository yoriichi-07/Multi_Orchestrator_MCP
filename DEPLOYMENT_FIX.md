# Docker Deployment Fix

## Problem Summary
The Smithery deployment was failing because there was a conflict between our custom startup script and Smithery's own startup process. Smithery uses `/usr/local/bin/startup.sh` which expects simple, direct container execution rather than custom startup scripts.

## Root Causes
1. **Startup Script Conflict**: Custom `/app/start-production.sh` conflicted with Smithery's startup process
2. **Complex ENTRYPOINT**: Custom startup script added unnecessary complexity
3. **Smithery Architecture**: Smithery expects simple, direct execution patterns like other MCP reference servers

## Solution Applied
1. **Simplified Dockerfile**: Removed custom startup script, using direct `ENTRYPOINT ["python", "mcp_server.py"]`
2. **Aligned with Reference Patterns**: Followed the same pattern as other successful MCP servers on Smithery
3. **Clean Configuration**: Removed conflicting startCommand from smithery.yaml to avoid confusion

## Verification Steps
1. Run `docker-test.sh` locally to verify build
2. Check that container starts directly: `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 <image>`
3. Test HTTP endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
4. Verify no startup script conflicts

## Deployment Process
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to repository
3. Smithery will automatically rebuild and deploy
4. Monitor deployment logs for successful startup

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check Smithery logs for specific error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Python application starts correctly with direct execution
4. Test locally using the provided test script
