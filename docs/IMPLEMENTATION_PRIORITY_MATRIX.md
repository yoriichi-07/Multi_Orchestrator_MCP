# Implementation Priority Matrix - Multi Orchestrator MCP

## Critical Path Analysis

### Phase 1: Foundation Repair (URGENT - 2 Weeks)
**Impact**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Risk**: LOW

#### Immediate Fixes Required

| Fix | Class | Method | Error | Impact | Effort |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| ðŸ”´ System Status | `AgentOrchestrator` | `get_status()` | Missing method | Cannot monitor health | 2 days |
| ðŸ”´ Architecture Gen | `AgentOrchestrator` | `generate_architecture()` | Missing method | Core value prop broken | 3 days |
