Of course. Welcome back. Let's get you started immediately with a sophisticated, end-to-end plan designed to win.

Given the hackathon's focus on creating a secure, permissioned, and observable interface layer for autonomous agents, we will build the most ambitious and relevant project: an autonomous system that doesn't just use software, but builds, tests, and corrects it.

The Project: The Autonomous Software Foundry 🏭
Your MCP server will be an orchestrator that manages a team of specialized AI agents (Frontend, Backend, Reviewer) to build a full-stack web application from a single user prompt. Its key innovation is a "self-healing" loop, where a Reviewer agent automatically tests the generated code and deploys other agents to fix bugs.

This project perfectly showcases the need for Cequence and Descope. Managing a team of agents with access to code generation, testing, and file system tools is a high-stakes task that demands the robust security and observability that the sponsors provide.

The Winning Narrative
Your story for the judges is simple and powerful: "While anyone can ask an LLM to write code, the result is an unreliable prototype. We've built a reliable software factory. Our system uses specialized agents, a curated prompt library for quality control, and a closed-loop feedback system to test and automatically fix its own code. Every step is secured by Descope's granular permissions and made fully observable by Cequence, transforming a chaotic process into a trustworthy, production-ready engineering system."

The Championship Roadmap
This is a detailed, phase-by-phase guide to execution. Follow these steps to build a winning demo.

Phase 1: The Secure Foundation (First ~5 Hours)
Objective: De-risk all external dependencies and establish a secure, observable "hello world" before writing any complex logic.

Environment & Server Setup (1 hour):

Create your repository and a Python/FastAPI project.

Define a single, dead-simple MCP tool: ping(), which returns { "message": "pong" }.

Test this tool locally with an MCP client like the Cloudflare MCP Playground to ensure the basic server works.

Descope Identity Integration (1.5 hours):

In the Descope dashboard, create a Non-Human Identity for your orchestrator agent. This is a critical step that differentiates your project.

Define a test scope (e.g., tools:ping).

Write a FastAPI middleware to validate the Descope JWT and check for this scope.

Milestone: Your ping() tool is now protected. It fails without a valid token and succeeds with one. You have established the core of your permission model.

Deployment & Cequence Gateway (2.5 hours):

Deploy your simple, authenticated "ping" server to a platform like Render or Fly.io.

Onboard your deployed API endpoint to the Cequence AI Gateway. Configure it to proxy requests and validate authentication.

Update your MCP client to point to the new, public Cequence endpoint.

Milestone: You can successfully call the ping() tool through the Cequence gateway, and you can see the request appear on your Cequence dashboard. Your entire security and communication pipeline is now validated end-to-end.

Phase 2: The Core Generation Engine (Next ~10 Hours)
Objective: Build the machinery that generates the "first-draft" version of the full-stack application.

The Prompt Library (1 hour):

Create a prompts.json file. Hand-craft 3-5 high-quality, detailed system prompts for a Frontend agent (React/Next.js) and a Backend agent (FastAPI). This is the "intellectual property" of your system.

The Prompt Supercharger & Agent Runner (4 hours):

Build the supercharge_prompt() tool. This internal function selects the best prompt from your library for a given task.

Build the run_agent() tool. This is a wrapper for your chosen LLM API. It takes a supercharged prompt, generates the code, and—crucially—saves the output files to separate, agent-specific directories (e.g., /outputs/frontend/).

The Hardcoded Orchestrator (5 hours):

Write the internal orchestration logic. This will be a hardcoded function that defines the build plan (the Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG).

The logic will call your supercharge_prompt and run_agent tools in sequence for each agent (Frontend, Backend).

Milestone: Your system can now take a single internal command and generate a complete, multi-directory codebase for a full-stack application.

Phase 3: The Self-Healing Innovation Loop 🔁 (Next ~8 Hours)
Objective: Transform your code generator into a self-correcting system. This is the phase that will win the hackathon.

The Merger & Reviewer Toolkit (3 hours):

Build the merge_outputs() tool, which combines the agent outputs and adds a static docker-compose.yml.

Build the Reviewer's tools: internal functions that wrap command-line tools like pytest (for backend tests), eslint (for frontend linting), and a secret scanner. These functions must capture the pass/fail status and the error logs.

The Reviewer Agent & The Loop (5 hours):

Create a new Reviewer agent prompt in your library. Its job is to analyze failed test logs and generate a concise "fix-it" prompt for another agent.

Update your orchestrator logic to implement the full loop: Generate -> Merge -> Review.

If the review fails, the orchestrator takes the "fix-it" prompt from the Reviewer, re-runs the appropriate agent, and triggers the review again.

Crucial Scope Control: Limit the self-healing loop to one attempt. If it fails a second time, it stops. This ensures your demo is quick and predictable.

Milestone: You have a working demo where you can show the initial code failing a test, followed by the system autonomously identifying the failure, generating a fix, and verifying that the fix works.

Phase 4: The Flawless Demo (Final ~6 Hours)
Objective: Craft and perfect a compelling story and presentation.

The Main MCP Tool (1 hour):

Create the single, primary, user-facing MCP tool: generate_app(goal: str). This tool will trigger your entire internal orchestration and self-healing workflow.

Craft Your Championship Story (2 hours):

Write and rehearse your demo script. Don't just show features; tell a story about building reliable, secure AI systems.

Set up your screen with four windows: the MCP client, the Cequence dashboard, the terminal showing server logs (and test failures!), and the final running web app.

Rehearse and Record (3 hours):

Practice the demo flow until it is seamless. The key moment is pointing out the failed test and watching the system fix itself.

Record a video of a perfect run as a backup in case of live demo issues.

Milestone: A polished, confident, and mind-blowing presentation that clearly demonstrates the superiority of your orchestrated, self-healing approach over a simple "black box" LLM.
