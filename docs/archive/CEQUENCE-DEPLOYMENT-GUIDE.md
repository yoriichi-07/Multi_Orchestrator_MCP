# Cequence AI Gateway Deployment Guide

## Current Status ✅

✅ **App Created Successfully**
- App Name: Multi Agent Orchestrator MCP
- OpenAPI Specification: Uploaded successfully
- Endpoints Parsed: 13 total endpoints recognized
- Categories: MCP Protocol, Autonomous Generation, Healing, Quality Assurance, Infrastructure, Analytics

✅ **Vercel Cleanup Complete**
- Removed all Vercel deployment files and references
- Updated OpenAPI specs to use Smithery URLs exclusively
- Clean, focused deployment strategy maintained

✅ **Working Smithery Deployment**
- URL: https://server.smithery.ai/@yoriichi-07/multi_orchestrator_mcp/mcp
- Authentication: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE with Descope (working correctly)
- Status: Production ready and responding correctly

### Step 2: MCP Server Setup Configuration

**Recommended Settings:**
```
Server Name: Multi-Agent-Orchestrator-MCP
Description: Enterprise MCP server for autonomous software generation with self-healing capabilities and comprehensive analytics
Log Level: Non-Production Mode (for debugging and tracing)
```

**Rationale:**
- Non-Production Mode provides verbose logs helpful for debugging during initial deployment
- Can switch to Production Mode later for optimized performance
- Clear naming convention matches our existing deployment patterns

### Step 3: Authentication Configuration

**Authentication Type: OAuth 2.0**

**Configuration Details:**
```
Authorization URL: https://auth.descope.io/P31WC6A6Vybbt7N5NhnH4dZLQgXY/oauth2/v1/authorize
Token URL: https://auth.descope.io/P31WC6A6Vybbt7N5NhnH4dZLQgXY/oauth2/v1/token
Client ID: [To be configured in Descope dashboard]
Client Secret: [To be configured in Descope dashboard]
Redirect URI: [Will be provided by Cequence after MCP server creation]
Scopes: tools:read tools:write admin:read (standard OAuth scopes)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Our existing Descope project ID: P31WC6A6Vybbt7N5NhnH4dZLQgXY
- OAuth 2.1 + PKCE already configured and working
- Authentication endpoints tested and verified
- Will need to update Descope configuration with new Cequence redirect URI

### Step 4: Review & Deploy

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
- [ ] Server name and description verified
- [ ] Authentication configuration matches Descope setup
- [ ] All 13 endpoints selected and configured
- [ ] Base URL pointing to working Smithery deployment
- [ ] Non-Production Mode selected for initial deployment

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Update Descope Configuration
After Cequence provides the redirect URI, update Descope OAuth application:
```
1. Login to Descope dashboard
2. Navigate to OAuth Applications
3. Add new redirect URI from Cequence
4. Update client configuration as needed
```

### 2. Test Integration
```bash
# Use Cequence-provided NPX command for Claude/Cursor integration
npx @cequenceai/mcp-cli connect --server [cequence-mcp-server-url]
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to .env.production
CEQUENCE_MCP_SERVER_URL=[final-cequence-url]
CEQUENCE_GATEWAY_ID=[provided-gateway-id]
CEQUENCE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with final Cequence deployment information
- [ ] Update competition submission with dual deployment strategy
- [ ] Add Cequence integration examples to demo materials

## Expected Timeline

**Deployment Phase: 5-10 minutes**
- Cequence MCP server deployment typically takes a few minutes
- Watch dashboard for "Deploying..." status to clear

**Testing Phase: 15 minutes**
- Integration with Claude/Cursor via NPX command
- Basic functionality testing
- Authentication flow verification

**Production Ready: 30 minutes total**
- Complete configuration updates
- Documentation finalization
- Competition submission preparation

## Success Criteria

✅ **Deployment Success:**
- Cequence MCP server shows "Running" status
- Server URL accessible and responding
- Authentication flow working end-to-end

✅ **Integration Success:**
- Claude/Cursor can connect to MCP server
- Tools available in LLM client
- API calls successfully routing through Cequence to Smithery

✅ **Competition Ready:**
- Dual deployment strategy (Smithery + Cequence) documented
- Professional integration demonstrating platform capabilities
- Working demo of multi-agent orchestration through MCP

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Issues:**
1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Descope OAuth configuration
   - Check redirect URI matches exactly
   - Confirm client ID/secret are correct

2. **Deployment Timeouts**
   - Wait for full deployment cycle (up to 10 minutes)
   - Check Cequence dashboard for error messages
   - Verify OpenAPI specification validity

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Ensure NPX command copied exactly
   - Check network connectivity to Cequence servers
   - Verify LLM client (Claude/Cursor) is updated
