**Quick Fix Example:**
```bash
# Get JWT token from your Access Key
python scripts/get_jwt_token.py YOUR_ACCESS_KEY

# Use the JWT token in Cursor IDE configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multi-orchestrator": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch", "YOUR_MCP_SERVER_URL"],
      "env": {
        "AUTHORIZATION": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"

    }
  }
}
```
